      Data shows affordable housing in Manhattan Community Board 1 is built mostly for higher-income households, not the poorest.

    <p>
      Affordable housing sounds simple, but the numbers in Manhattan Community Board 1 tell a different story. The district has between 600 and 700 total units, but only 86 are affordable for families who earn less than $60,000 a year. These are the residents who face the most pressure. At 30 percent of area median income, a three-person household must earn about $43,000 to qualify for an apartment, according to New York City’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development. This matters now because New York City has a new mayor-elect, Mandami, and families across the city are counting on him to take this crisis seriously.

      “This is not only about policy. It is about dignity,” said housing advocate Charles Powell. “If families who work every day cannot access homes labeled affordable, then the structure is the problem.”
    </p>

    <p>
      The gap between required income and available homes continues to push low-income residents out before they can apply.
